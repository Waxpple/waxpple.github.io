For example, I am using Xilinx-KC705 for my development.\nClass properties  device: a string. See the base platform class for which one to choose. This affects options passed to the toolchain so that it compiles for the correct chip. package: a string. See the base platform class for which one to choose. This affects options passed to the toolchain so that it compiles for the correct package of the chip. resources: a list of Resource. This names the pins you want to use, and configuration options for each such pin. default_clk: the name of the resource that is the clock for the default clock domain. default_rst: the name of the resource that is the reset for the default clock domain. connectors: optional, a list of Connector. It isn’t obvious what purpose this serves. It may have something to do with certain toolchains.  Resources A Resource is a structure that contains a name, a number, and one or more configuration items for the resource. Adding a Resource to a board does two things:\n configures pin on the device allows you to request a resource’s pin by name from the platform in your elaborate function.Such a pin has several signal associated with it, such as i for input and o for output, which you can then use in your module.  For example, by including this Resource into the platform’s resource list:\nResource(\"abc\", 0, Pins(\"J3\", dir=\"i\")) Then pin J3 on the device will be configured as an input, and you can request the abc resource’s input Signal like this\nplatform.request(\"abc\").i Resource configuration items  Pins: specifies the space-separated pin names associated with resource, their direction type, and whether the signal should be automativally inverted when crossing the pin(for, e.g., active low signals). Direction types are:    i: input only. Signal for the pin is .i o: output only. Signal for the pin is .o io: bidirectional. Signals for the pin are .o for the output, and .oe is the direction for the pin: 0 for input, 1 for output. oe: tristate. Signals for the pin .o for the output, and .oe to enable output: 0 for disable, 1 for enable.    PinsN: shorthand for Pins, where all pins are active low. DiffPairs: specifies the space-separated pin names for one or more differential pairs (positive and negative pins) Clock: specifies that the resource is a clock with the given frequency in Hz. Attrs: platform-specific attributes such as voltage standard to select.  A full resource specification for a clock pin used on a Lattice ICE40 board could be as follows:\nResource(\"clk\", 0, Pins(\"J3\",dir=\"i\"), Clock(12e6),Attrs(GLOBAL=True, IO_STANDARD=\"SB_LVCMOS\")) This example says that the clk resource is at pin J3 on the FPGA. J3 is defined by vender of your FPGA. For example, KC705 pin map can be found at here. clk has a frequency of 12MHz, is a “global” signal, and uses the LVCMOS voltage standard. Without knowing about the toolchain for the platform, you will not know what attributes are required.\nExample for the Xilinx-KC705. import os import subprocess from nmigen.build import * from nmigen.vendor.xilinx_7series import * from .resources import * __all__ = [\"KC705Platform\"] class KC705Platform(Xilinx7SeriesPlatform): device = \"xc7k325t\" package = \"ffg900\" speed = \"2\" default_clk = \"clk156\" resources = [ Resource(\"clk156\", 0, DiffPairs(\"K28\", \"K29\", dir=\"i\"), Clock(156e6), Attrs(IOSTANDARD=\"LVDS_25\")), *LEDResources(pins=\"AB8 AA8 AC9 AB9 AE26 G19 E18 F16\", attrs=Attrs(IOSTANDARD=\"LVCMOS15\")), UARTResource(0, rx=\"M19\", tx=\"K24\", attrs=Attrs(IOSTANDARD=\"LVCMOS33\") ), ] connectors = [] def toolchain_program(self, products, name): openocd = os.environ.get(\"OPENOCD\", \"openocd\") with products.extract(\"{}.bit\".format(name)) as bitstream_filename: subprocess.check_call([openocd, \"-c\", \"source [find board/kc705.cfg]; init; pld load 0 {}; exit\" .format(bitstream_filename) ]) if __name__ == \"__main__\": from .test.blinky import * KC705Platform().build(Blinky(), do_program=True) You can see that it is not well define yet.

To get around this, for each such input, place this in your main before the Simulator construction:\ninput1 = Signal() m.d.comb += yourmodule.input1.eq(input1) ... sim = Simulator(m) Inside your process, refer to this input as input1, not yourmodule.input1. This will force nMigen to include input1 in the trace file.\n Define your clocks, if any If you have clocks, add each clock after the Simulator constrction, giving the clock period in seconds. For example, a 100MHz clock for clock domain fast_clock and a nearly 166MHz clock for faster clock.\n... sim = Simulator() sim.add_clock(1e-8,domain=\"fast_clock\") sim.add_clock(6e-9,domain=\"faster_clock\") Leaving out domain will cause the clock period to be assigned to the default clock domain, sync.\nThe process function The process function is a Python generator that nMigen calls to see what to do next in the simulation. Since it is a generator, process must yield a statement to perform. For example:\ndef process(): yield x.eq(0) yield y.eq(0xFF) The above would set x to 0 and y to 0xFF, with effectively no delay between them. You can yield nMigen Value, which you can then use to do various comparisons.\ndef process(): yield x.eq(0) yield Delay(1e-8) # delay 10 nano seconds yie y.eq(0xFF) yield Settle() # force all combinational computation to happen. got = yield yourmodule.sum want = yield (x+y)[:8] if got != want: print(f\"Error, result={got:02x},golden={want:02x}) In the above example, x will be set to 0, then there will be 10 ns delay, then y will be set to 0xFF, all combinational logic will be given a chance to settle, and finally yourmodule.sum and (x+y)[:8] will be evaluated, and if they are not equal, a diagnostic message is sent to the terminal output.\nYou can even have more that one process running parallel.\ndef x_process(): yield Delay(1e-6) yield x.eq(0) yield Settle() def y_process(): yield Delay(1.2e-6) yield y.eq(0xFF) yield Settle() sim.add_process(x_process) sim.add_process(y_process) In the above example, x will be set to 0 at time 1 us, and y will be set to 0xFF at time 1.2 us.\nWarning: driving the same signal from more than one process can lead to undefined behavior if both processes assign to the signal simultaneously.\nNon-synchronous processes If you want to specify exactly when signals change based on time, then you can create a non-synchronous process. You must add such a process to the simulator via add_process:\nsim.add_process(process) Synchronous process If you want to specify when signals change base on clock edges, then you can create a synchronous process. You can add such a process to the simulator via add_sync_process, specifying the clock domain it should be clocked from:\nsim.add_sync_process(process1, domain= \"name1\") sim.add_sync_process(process2, domain= \"name2\") If you yield with no value from a synchronous process, then the process will wait for the next clock edge. Note that for synchronous processes, one clock edge will occur before the process starts, so take that into account when you look at your traces. It is also important to understand when statements are executed in relation to clock edges. They are always executed infinitesimally after the previous clock edge. Thus, in this example.\ndef process(): yield x.eq(0) #step1 yield #step2 yield x.eq(1) #step3 yield #step4 There will be one clock edge that always takes place before the process runs. Then x is set to 0 (step 1). Then another clock edge happens(step 2). x is set to 1 infinitesimally after that clock edge (step 3). Then another clock signals that appear to change coincident with a clock edge actuvally change just after that clock edge. Outputs that change like that can be consider to have been “driven” by the clock edge.\nPassive and active processes Processed may be passive or active. When an active process runs out of things to tell the simulator to do, it asks the simulator to finish. In effect, it controls the endpoint of the simulator. The simulation ends when all active processes are done. A passive process, on the other hand, doesn’t ask the simulator to finish.\nBy default, processes added with add_process and add_sync_process are active. A process can change its mode using yield Active() or yield Passive().\nEnding the simulation As mentioned above, the simulation ends when all active processes are done. This is how sim.run() works.\nHowever, you can instead use sim.run_until(), which lets you end the simulation at a particular time. The run_passive key is False by default, meaning that the simulation will also end if all active processes are done. This behavior can be changed by setting run_passive to True, in which case the simulation will only end once the specified time is reached. For example, the following will run the simulation for 100 microseconds and then stop, regardless of whether the active processes are done.\nwith sim.write_vcd(\"test.vcd\", \"test.gtkw\", traces=yourmodule.ports()): sim.run_until(100e-6, run_passive=True) Running the simulation and viewing the output The simulation is run simply by running the main module:\npython3 main_module.py The output should be a test.vcd file and a test.gtkw file. Running gtkwave will allow you to view the output. Running it on test.vcd will make you select the signals you want to see when gtkwave opens, while running it on test.gtkw will open gtkwave showing the signals in the traces key that you you gave in the call to sim.write_vcd().\ngtkwave test.vcd gtkwave test.gtkw ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"[Day05] Simulations","uri":"/posts/day05/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Spliting and combining signals Slicing signals We can get the least significant bit by x[0] or the most significant bit by x[15].\n\u003e\u003e\u003e from nmigen import * \u003e\u003e\u003e x = Signal(16) \u003e\u003e\u003e x (sig x) \u003e\u003e\u003e x.shape() Shape(width=16, signed=False) \u003e\u003e\u003e x[15] (slice (sig x) 15:16) \u003e\u003e\u003e x[15].shape() Shape(width=1, signed=False) While x[7:0] is the way to extract the eight least significant bits in verilog.But in nMigen we use x[0:8] or x[:8].

So a 16-bit overflow is not a 17-bit overflow, and this will result in comparison failure. Such as a = 0xffff and b = 0x0001, the addition will be z = 0x10000, which obviously not zero as we expected.\nTherefore, be careful to slice the result\nm.d.comb += z.eq((a+b)[:16] == 0) Alternatively, just use an intermediate signal (not recommanded):\ntmp = Signal(unsigned(16)) m.d.comb += tmp.eq(a+b) m.d.comb += z.eq(tmp == 0) This becomes especially insidious when combining unsigned and signed signals:\nptr = Signal(unsigned(16)) addr = Signal(unsigned(16)) offset = Signal(signed(5)) m.d.comb += ptr.eq(addr + offset) we expect ptr to be a 16-bit value, since that is what we set it to be. However, what happens here? Suppose addr is 0 and offset is -1. Will this comparison work? No, sorry my dear. It wouldn’t work. Consider that adder range from 0x7FFF to 0xFFFF and offset range from 0x7 to 0xF, which is max((+32767 ~ -32768) + (+7 ~ -8) )= 0x8006\ny = Signal() m.d.comb += y.eq((addr + offset) == 0xFFFF ) So the result of addr+offset in this is -1, which 2’s complement 18-bit is 0x3FFFF. If we slice it, it will be 0xFFFF.\nConcatenating signals You can create a new signal out of other signals using Cat:\nm.d.comb += x.eq(Cat(a, b, ...)) This concatenates the given signals first element last This is important that a in the example above ends up as the least significant bits of x. That is, the concatenation of a and b is not ab but ba.\nIt is now easy to swap the bytes of a 16-bit signal:\nm.d.sync += x.eq(Cat(x[8:], x[:8])) You can also assign to a Cat, so swapping the bytes can be accomplished in this way also:\nm.d.sync += Cat(x[8:], x[:8]).eq(x) Replicating signals You can replicate a signal by concatenating it to itself via Cat(x,x). But you can also replicate the signal via Repl(x,2) Repl with Cat can be used together to, for example, signed-extend a value:\nuint16 = Signal(unsigned(16)) int32 = Signal(signed(32)) m.d.comb += int32.eq(Cat(uint16, Repl(uint16[15],16))) Of course, the same can be done by simply using the right signal types:\nuint16 = Signal(unsigned(16)) int32 = Signal(signed(32)) m.d.comb += int32.eq(uint16) The generated cide will do the right thing.\nArrays You can create an array of signals like this:\n# All of these create an array of 3 16-bit elements: # Creates an array from a, b, c: a = Signal(unsigned(16)) b = Signal(unsigned(16)) c = Signal(unsigned(16)) abc = Array([a, b, c]) # Creates an array of 16-bit signals: x = Array([Signal(unsigned(16)), Signal(unsigned(16)), Signal(unsigned(16)) ]) # Also creates an array of 16-bit signals, taking y = Array([Signal(unsigned(16)) for_ in range(3)]) You can even create multidimensional arrays:\n# Creates a 3 by 5 array of 16-bit signals: yy = Array([Array[Signal(unsigned(16)) for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(3) ]) You can index into the array with a constant:\nz = y[2] This will result in an “elaborate time” error if the index is out of bounds. However, you can also index with another signal:\ni = Signal(unsigned(16)) z = y[i] Of course, during elaboration this will not result in any error. The actual result depends on runtime. It is best to ensure as much as possible that your access is not invalid. One way is to declare the index to only have a valid range.\ny = Array([Signal(unsigned(16)) for _ in range(5)]) i = Signal.range(5) z = y[i] Of course, there is nothing to prevent i from being 5, 6, or 7, since it is a 3-bit signal. Another way is to simply deal with invalid values:\ny = Array([Signal(unsigned(16)) for _ in range(5)]) i = Signal.range(5) z = y[i % 4] Note here, it will still result in unexpected result. In the end, you will have to formally verify that i will only contain valid values.\nRecords A Record is a bundle of signals. To define a Record, we first must define a Layout.\nLayouts from nmigen.hdl.rec import * class MyLayout(Layout): def __init__(self): super().__init__([ (\u003csignal_name\u003e, \u003cshape|layout\u003e [, \u003cdirection\u003e]), (\u003csignal_name\u003e, \u003cshape|layout\u003e [, \u003cdirection\u003e]), ]) Here is an example of a bus with 8-bit data, 16-bit address line, and some control signals:\nclass BusLayout(Layout): def __init__(self): super().__init__([ (\"data\", unsigned(8)), (\"addr\", unsigned(16)), (\"wr\",1), (\"en\",1), ]) If your bus is very complex and easy to reuse another bus, you can define a bus by another bus.\nclass DataBusLayout(Layout): def __init__(self): super().__init__([ (\"data\",unsigned(8)) ]) class AddrBusLayout(Layout): def __init__(self): super().__init__([ (\"addr\",unsigned(16)) ]) class AllBusLayout(Layout): def __init__(self): super().__init__([ (\"addr_bus\",AddrBusLayout()), (\"data_bus\",DataBusLayout()), ]) Laying out a record with a layout Once a Layout is defined, you can define a Record using that Layout, and use it as a signal:\nclass Bus(Record): def __init__(self): super().__init__(BusLayout()) ... # Later in a module: self.bus = Bus() m.d.comb += self.bus.data.eq(0xFF) m.d.sync += self.bus.wr.eq(0) # Can assign a bus by a bus self.bus2 = Bus() m.d.comb += self.bus2.eq(self.bus) Directions and connecting records It is often advantageous to define signals so that the zero value means either invalid or inactive. That way, you can have many of those signals and logical-or them together. For example, you might have three modules, each of which output a one-bit write signal, but only one module will write at a time. Then if your write signal is active high( zeros means no write), you can simply logical-or the write signal from each module together to get a master write signal. self.master_record = Bus() m.d.comb += self.master_record.connect(bus1, bus2, bus3, ...) The connect method on a record returns an array of statement which logical-ors each signal together. The exactly same thing could be accomplished “manually”.\nself.master_record = Bus() m.d.comb += self.master_record.eq(bus1 | bus2 | bus3 |...) The disadvantage is that connect can connect parts of records, if the field names matched. In this sense, the “subordinate” records must have every signal that the “master” record has. That is, the “subordinate” records can have extra signals, but the “master” record must not.\nFan-out is where each subordinate record gets a copy of the master record. If the direction of each signal in the layout of record is DIR_FANOUT, then you can connect several records to a “master” record like this:\nself.master_record = Bus() m.d.comb += self.master_record.connect(bus1, bus2, bus3, ...) The syntax is exactly the same, but the direction is different, from master record to each subordinate record. Again, you could do this “manually”:\nself.master_record = Bus() m.d.comb += [ bus1.eq(self.master_record), bus2.eq(self.master_record), bus3.eq(self.master_record), ... ] But this is longer, and also doesn’t handle when the master record has extra signals that not in the subordinate records.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"[Day04] Bit selection","uri":"/posts/day04/"},{"categories":null,"content":"If-Elif-Else you cannot use the standard python if-elif-else statements to create statements.

You can use multiple values in one case statement.\nwith m.Switch(expression): with m.Case(value1,value2): statements1 with m.Default(): statements3 You can leave out the Defalt(), but not suggest you to do that.\nm.d.comb += x.eq(1) with m.Switch (y): with m.Case(0,1,2): m.d.comb += x.eq(2) In this example, if y is in [0, 1, 2] then x is assigned 2. Otherwise x retains its value of 1.\n Recall the section on overriding statements. One signal can only assigned in only one clock domain.  Specify a bit patterns The way to specify a matching pattern in a Case is with a Python string of binary digits. For example, \"0011101011\". A don’t-care bit is specified using a dash -, so for example \"00111-----\". The number of bits in the string must exactly the same as the number of bits in the expression it is being compared to.\nwith m.If(a.matches(\"11---\",3,b)): statement1 Is equivelent to\nwith m.Switch(a): with m.Case(\"11---\",3,b): statement1 ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"[Day03] Branching","uri":"/posts/day03/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Domains A domain in its basic definition, is a grouping of logic cells. If consider a module as a blackbox. With its inputs and outputs, any given output is generated within one and only one domain.\nModules come with two domain built in: a combinational domain and a sequential(synchronous) domain.\nCombinational Logic that contains no clocked elements is called combinational logic. This is one of the domain that a Module contains. It is always named comb, and it can be accessed via m.d.comb.\nm means Module and d means domain.\nSynchronous Logic that contains clocked elements is called synchronous (a.k.a sequential circuit) because all the FFs are triggered by particular clock domain. Each clock domain also has a reset signal which can reset all FFs to a given state. Finally, the domain specifies the edge of its clock on which all the FFs change: posedge or negedge.\nUnless otherwise specified, there is one synchronous domain in a Module called sync. It can be accessed via m.d.sync.\nCreating more domains There is no reason to create combinational domains. As mentioned above, modules already contain one combinational domain, comb.\nYou can create a synchronous clock domain using ClockDomain(\"\u003cdomain-name\u003e\", clk_edge=\"pos|neg\"). This gives you both the clock and the reset signal for the domain. By default, the domain name is sync and the clock edge is pos.\nm = Module() mydomain = ClockDomain(\"clk\") m.domains += mydomain m.d.mydomain += ... # logic to add in the \"mydomain\" clock domain. You can access a domain within a module by its name. So a domain created via ClockDomain(“my clock”) is accessed via m.d.myclock or m.d[\"myclk\"]. \\\n ClockSignal(domain=\"\u003cdomain\u003e\") gives you the clock signal for the given domain. ResetSignal(domain=\"\u003cdomain\u003e\") gives you the reset signal for the given domain.  Tips: Clock domains with the same clock but different edges. This can be done simply by creating one clockdomain\npos = ClockDomain(\"pos\") neg = ClockDomain(\"neg\", clk_edge=\"neg\") Next, assign them with same clock driven\nneg.clk = pos.clk neg.rst = pos.rst And then you can add these to the module. We can add more than domain to a module with the same statement.\nm.domains += [pos, neg] Access to domains A module can access its domains via its d attribute. By default, if a synchronous domain is added to a module’s domain, then all modules everywhere will also have access to that domain via their d attribute, even if that module is not a submodule of the module where the domain was added.\nm = Module() m2 = Module() m.domains += ClockDomain(\"thing\") m.d.thing += # logic # This is implicity m2.d.thing += #logic If you want to explicitly inhibit this global propagation by setting the local named parameter of the ClockDomain to True.\nm = Module() m2 = Module() m.domains += ClockDomain(\"thing\", local=True) m.d.thing += # logic # Error will occur here. m2.d.thing += # logic Ports The equivalent of ports in a module is public attributes. In the following example, a and data are publicly available to other modules, while b is not, just as a and data are publicly available to other python classes, and b is not.\nclass ThingBlock(Elaboratable): def __init__(self): # Public accessible self.a = Signal() self.data = Signal(8) def elaborate(self, platform: str): m = Module() # Internal use reg/wire. b = Signal() return m Reset/default values for signals If a Signal is set in the combinational or synchronous domain, then you can specify the default value of the signal if it is not set. By default value of the signal if it is not set. By default, it is zero, but for a non-zero value, you can specify the default value for a signal when constructing the signal by setting the reset named parameter in the constructor. For example, this create a 16-bit signed signal, self.x, which initial value set to 0xFFFF.\nself.x = Signal(signed(16), reset=0xFFFF) # initial value \"0xFFFF\" Explicitly not resetting For synchronous signals(that is, a signal set in a synchronous domain), you can specify that it is not reset on the reset signal, instead only getting an initial balue on power-up. This is done by setting the reset_less named parameter in the constructor to True\nself.x = Signal(signed(16),reset= 0xFFFF, reset_less = True) This is especially useful during simulation or formal verification where you want to activate the reset, but keep some signals “outside” the reset. For example, a cycle counter that maintains its count across resets.\nBasic operations Statements nMigen doesn’t convert Python to hardware. In essence, what you are writing using nMigen is a generator of logic, not the logic itself. So if you want to assign one Value to take the value of another, you don’t write a = b, but instead you call the method of a that generates the equality: a.eq(b). This is known as a statement.\nHowever, many math operators are overridable in Python, since these translate to calls to Python functions. So for example, you can write a.eq(b+1) instead of something like a.eq(b.plus(1)) because Python addition can be overrideen to a function callm and nMigen’s Signal class does that for all such operators (= is still not overrided).\nList of directly translatable Python operators    Operator Operation Notes     ~ inversion    - arithmetic negation    + addition    * multiplication    % modulus    // division integer division, rounding down   \u003c\u003c shift left    \u003e\u003e shift right Effectively arithmetic, see below.   \u0026 bitwise and    ` ` bitwise or   ^ bitwise xor    == equality    != inequality    \u003e greater than    \u003e= greater than or equal to    \u003c less than    \u003c= less than equal to      Note that there are no translatable Python logical operators (and,or). The logical reduction functions any and all are not avaliable in nMigen expressions.\nAttemped to convert nMigen value to boolean error will occur.\n  Shift right is effectively arithmetic, where the sign bit is present for signed values or zero for unsigned Values.\n Effects of operations on result width Two unsigned/signed 4-bit signals addition will result in unsigned/signed 5-bit result.\n\u003e\u003e\u003e s1 = Signal(signed(4)) \u003e\u003e\u003e s2 = Signal(signed(4)) \u003e\u003e\u003e v2 = s1 + s2 \u003e\u003e\u003e v2.shape() Shape(width=5, signed=True) Multiplexing signals Mux() returns one signal if the condition is true, the other signal otherwise:\ny.eq(Mux(cond,x1,x2)) In this case, if cond is true then y is set to x1, otherwise x2. It is the same as y = cond?x1:x2;.\nMux cannot be used on the left-hand side of any assignment.\nPlacing statements in domains Statements are written in the combinational domain of a module as we used to in verilog. Ofcourse, can be used in sequential circuits.\n# Combinational circuit m.d.comb += x.eq(y+1) # Sequential circuit m.d.sync += x.eq(y+1) For example, y is IDLE and x is next_state.\nAdding multiple statements The += operator for a domain can take one statement, or a list of statements, which is pretty ease to use.\nm.d.comb += [ x.eq(y+1), z.eq(w+2) ] Conflict statements will be override If a statement sets the same signal that previous statement set, the the second set takes precedence.\nm.d.comb += x.eq(y+1) m.d.comb += x.eq(y+2) In this case, x will get y+2 not y+1. Remember that one signal can only be assigned to one domains, otherwise, it will result in a driver-driver conflict.\n# Wrong code m.d.comb += x.eq(y+1) m.d.sync += x.eq(y+1) ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"[Day02] Basic terminology","uri":"/posts/day02/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Basic structure of modules The tutorial is followed by https://github.com/RobertBaruch/nmigen-tutorial/ Thumbs up for his contributions.\nfrom nmigen import * from nmigen.build import Platform class ThingBlock(Elaboratable): def __init__(self): pass def elaborate(self, platform: Platform) -\u003e Module: m = Module() return m Elaborating a module from nmigen.cli import main if __name__== \"__main__\": sync = ClockDomain() block = ThingBlock() m = Module() m.domains += sync m.submodules += block main(m, ports=[sync.clk,sync.rst])  main(module, ports=[], platform=\"\") translate the given module into verilog.
