# What is the difference between RISC and CISC?

CISC (Complex-Instrument-Set-Computer) is an instrument set that contains common instruments and uncommon instruments. For example, 80% of the common instruments we used in the arithmetic program is 20% of the total instrument set.

RISC (Reduced-Instrument-Set-Computer) only contains common instruments. It will use more than one simple instrument to finshed one complex instrument which takes more cycles to do the same job but keep the processor simple and clean.
